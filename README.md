The HR analytics dataset project in Tableau is a comprehensive visualization of various HR metrics such as employee headcount, and retention. The project provides insights into how organizations can leverage HR data to make informed decisions about their workforce. The dataset used in this project includes information about Attrition Rate, Employees demographics and more.

The project includes various visualizations such as a trend analysis of attrition over time, a breakdown of attrition by department, and an analysis of factors that contribute to attrition. These visualizations provide HR professionals and business leaders with valuable insights into their organization's attrition rates and help them develop strategies to reduce it.


The project is designed to be viewed in Tableau as it allows users to interact with the dynamic visualizations and explore the data in a more comprehensive way.
